PROJECT DESCRIPTION.

This respository collects the pipeline and some output from our research on the proliferation of LEDs in response to 2017 NYC retrofitted policy. 


Today, lighting has become an integral part of city operations, especially for energy conservation ([Dubois et al., 2011](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778811002933?casa_token=91IH26yCMqQAAAAA:JlWBUqcO775K1m91zBknN_UKtE3K-8RoGtB1I7QZtQ62QdxUMHJ68lrNXe-2_fkh-h9ryjWbkQ), [Montoya et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778816314967?casa_token=LRgEMMcaLEUAAAAA:pcb7VNp0k7m4qJiNSvEipMCm9IYMbKaQGdfQmG2El-N6tx_qvjz78TnvTuRCh6i80_EDh360dA)) and associated reductions in carbon emissions ([Azevedo et al., 2009](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4804756/), [Humphreys, 2008](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mrs-bulletin/article/solidstate-lighting/7FE266662925E382E933DF0616929C77), [Principi and Fioretti, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652614007392?casa_token=rs0lkpO2g2AAAAAA:C7IIuJUz25KiAvQw_UFhOVgclnAFtPUuzYza0aq1ufCuA99owofZDoApjbXEepq5KFQRb266ag) ). From 2003 to 2012, electricity consumption for lighting in commercial buildings had decreased from 38% to 17% ([EIA, 2022](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/electricity/use-of-electricity.php)), while other categories, such as cooking, heating, and cooling, had continued to increase. Electricity used for lighting has declined over time due to the development of lighting technology that can achieve higher energy efficiency with better lighting quality ([Montoya et al., 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778816314967?casa_token=LRgEMMcaLEUAAAAA:pcb7VNp0k7m4qJiNSvEipMCm9IYMbKaQGdfQmG2El-N6tx_qvjz78TnvTuRCh6i80_EDh360dA), [Principi and Fioretti, 2014](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652614007392?casa_token=rs0lkpO2g2AAAAAA:C7IIuJUz25KiAvQw_UFhOVgclnAFtPUuzYza0aq1ufCuA99owofZDoApjbXEepq5KFQRb266ag), [Dupuis & Krames, 2008](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4542883), [Quirk, 2009](https://nature.berkeley.edu/classes/es196/projects/2009final/QuirkI_2009.pdf)). Although new lighting technologies have advantages in durability and energy efficiency, the resistance to change imposed by the current technological trajectory slowed the transition ([Lefevre et al, 2006](https://www.oecd.org/env/cc/37671771.pdf), [Menaneau and Lefebvre, 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733399000384), [Almeida et al., 2013](https://www02.core.ac.uk/download/pdf/38627595.pdf), [Maria et al., 2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-9485.2009.00506.x), [Khorasanizadeh, 2016](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652616305340?casa_token=WUi6sf_YJ6wAAAAA:yO-kfIDGQjPgPeVamoBOzPlzTFDVL-sAoUwQYvGyrQcWwGeZXWb8maeEiZyhT7hk6zmvZaC73Q)). As an example, LED sales were only 1% in 2010, and only 7% until 2014 ([IEA, 2021](https://www.iea.org/reports/lighting)).Technological trajectory is defined as a path by which innovation occurred and improved to the highest possible efficiency level ([Sharma and Tripathi, 2017](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/technological-trajectory#:~:text=Technological%20trajectories%20can%20be%20defined,and%20economic%20factors%20%5B17%5D.)). And this resistance is caused by the unpredictability of technological evolution and the invasion of the mainstream market. In examining the technological competition between incandescent lamps and CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lamps), [Menaneau and Lefebvre (2000)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733399000384) identified three factors that contributed to this slow development. First of all, new technologies have not benefited from cumulative learning or economies of scale. Also, dominant technologies develop evaluation standards based on their inherent advantages (for example, incandescent lamps are more appealing to customers because they are less expensive). Finally, there is inaction among various stakeholders. Further barriers to the diffusion of CFL technology are identified by [Haworth and Rosenow (2013)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301421513011907): obtaining information about a new product requires much time and effort, some CFLs are ugly, and so on. 

Meanwhile, researchers believe that public policies, such as tax rebates, subsidization, and phase-out of incandescent light bulbs play a decisive complementary role in overcoming the “lock-in” situation. Therefore, as a national leader in using sustainable street lighting, NYC Department of Transportation (DOT) operated the largest municipal street lighting system in the United States and launched LED pilot projects and programs to evaluate LED luminaires’ performance in energy saving and carbon emission reduction. In 2013, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and Transportation Commissioner Janette Sadik-Khan announced that 250,000 high-pressure sodium street lights were planned to be replaced by LEDs by 2017. 


In this research, using empirical measurements of lighting technology use via time-dependent images of the Manhattan skyline, we will show the changeover from energy inefficient to energy-efficient lighting and the proliferation of LED.


The hyperspectral imaging data used in this work was obtained by the “Urban
Observatory” (UO) facility in New York City (NYC). This VNIR instrument
observation is located in downtown Brooklyn and faces north. Two night-time hyper-spectral images (one from the 2015 and the other from the 2018) of NYC have been used to identify and type lighting technologies.
